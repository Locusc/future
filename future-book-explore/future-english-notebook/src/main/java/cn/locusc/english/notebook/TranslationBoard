These are the items emitted by the Flux

This vertical line indicates that
the Flux has completed successfully

This is the timeline of the Flux
Time flows from left to right

These dotted lines and this box
indicate that a transformation
is being applied to the Flux
The text inside the box shows
the nature of the transformation

This Flux is the result
of the transformation

If for some reason the Flux terminates
abnormally, with an error, the vertical
line is replaced by an X

In this lesson we'll see different factory methods to create a Flux.
In imperative synchronous code, it's easy to manage exceptions with familiar try-catch blocks, throw instructions...
But in an asynchronous context, we have to do things a bit differently. Reactive Streams defines the onError signal to deal with exceptions.
Note that such an event is terminal: this is the last event the Flux will produce.
Flux#error produces a Flux that simply emits this signal, terminating immediately:

To finish with Flux, let's try to create a Flux that produces ten elements, at a regular pace.
In order to do that regular publishing, we can use interval.
But it produces an infinite stream (like ticks of a clock), and we want to take only 10 elements,
so don't forget to precise it.

Reactor ships with several operators that can be used to transform data.
